# Movies-ETL


### Purpose
 the purpose is to help Britta to gather data from both Wikipedia and Kaggle, combine them, and save them into a SQL database so that the hackathon participants have a nice, clean dataset to use. To do this, she will follow the ETL process: extract the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their respective files, transform the datasets by cleaning them up and joining them together, and load the cleaned dataset into a SQL database.
